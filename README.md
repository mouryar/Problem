# Problem

Fixed all errors in the code. 

# Findings:  
  
1. Code is not properly documented.   
2. All classes exist in a single java file.   
3. Add model classes in a separate package.  
4. As I felt that Calculator is service class, I moved it service class.  
5. Used builder pattern for Item class because in future we will end up adding more getters and setters.  
6. Wrote all possible test cases.  
7. Order class should have a no-arg constructor and OrderLine should be initialized.  
8. Used  for-each loop in Calculator instead of traditional for loop for better readability.   
9. Add method in Order should though IllegalArgumentException.
